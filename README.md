# Recipe posting website

This is a blog website built with:

* Frontend: React
* Backend: Node.js Express
* Database: MongoDB[cluster]

## Frontend (React)

The frontend uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages components for reusable UI elements.

*Components:*

* CreateBlog: Create new blog posts.
* Allpost: Display a list of all blog posts.
* Login: Login to the website.
* Signup: Sign up for an account.
* AdminLogin: Admin login access.
* Singlepost: View a single blog post.
* Admin: Admin dashboard.
    * CardList: List of users (Admin view).
    * BlogList: List of blog posts (Admin view).
* ProfilePage: User profile view.
* EditProfile: Edit user profile details.

## Backend (Node.js, Express)

The backend utilizes Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, and Express, a web framework for building web applications in Node.js. It handles API requests from the frontend and interacts with the database.

## Database (MongoDB)

MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores data in flexible JSON-like documents.

## Routes

*Frontend Routes*

* /: Displays all blog posts.
* /createblog: Creates a new blog post.
* /post/:id: Views a single blog post.
* /signup: Signs up for an account.
* /login: Logs in to the website.
* /userprofile: Shows the user's profile page.
* /editprofile: Allows editing user profile.
* /adminlogin: Admin login access.
* /admin: Admin dashboard with nested routes:
    * /admin/manage-users: Lists users (Admin view).
    * /admin/manage-posts: Lists blog posts (Admin view).

*Backend Routes (API)*

These routes are handled by the Express application and are typically accessed through AJAX requests from the frontend.

* *POST /api/auth/signup*: Route for user signup.
* *POST /api/auth/login*: Route for user login.
* *GET /api/posts*: Route to retrieve all blog posts.
* *GET /api/posts/:id*: Route to retrieve a single blog post (replace :id with the actual post ID).
* *POST /api/posts*: Route to create a new blog post.
* *PUT /api/posts/:id*: Route to update an existing blog post (replace :id with the actual post ID).
* *DELETE /api/posts/:id*: Route to delete a blog post (replace :id with the actual post ID).

*Explanation:*

* * in the route path indicates the default route for the frontend.
* :id in the route path represents a dynamic parameter that captures the post ID for single post retrieval and update/delete operations.
* **POST**, **GET**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** are HTTP methods used for different actions:
    * **GET**: Retrieves data from the server.
    * **POST**: Creates new data on the server.
    * **PUT**: Updates existing data on the server.
    * **DELETE**: Deletes data from the server.
* /api prefix is commonly used to denote API endpoints in web applications.

*Note:* These backend routes are typically not directly accessed by users in the browser. They are used by the frontend application through AJAX requests to interact with the server.
